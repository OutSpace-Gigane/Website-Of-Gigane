        My (Joshua's) THERE'S NO GOAL-Inspired Series Currently Focused on Ep1Seg3 
        since i'm not working for a long time and yeah lack of motivation <br>
        <h2> NO THUMBNAIL FOR NOW </h2> <br>

    <div class="GQK">
        <h1>Gigane'd Quantic Kingdom</h1> <br>
        The Quantum Googology (or for shorten, QG) Series that uses Holo-QG which is MORE POWERFUL
        than ANY Meta-QG <br>
        The Series uses "Build (any number here)" instead of Sections, Seasons [ETC.] so it makes THE SERIES very UNIQUE <br>
        <img src="images/0 â†’ 0(1).jpg" alt="Thumbnail of Part 3" height="200"> <br>
        Currently there's no planned final part <b> most likely 30, 40 or even.. 50! </b> <br>
    </div>

    <div class="BoNB">
        <h1>Beyond of Numeric Beyonds</h1> <br>
        and... Beyond of Osiris Legandria (N0tBTESN Finales) mostly uses Fictillar Hoyogosim (Powerful Version of Hologology) also It would be so hard to make 'cause IT HAS CUTSCENES <br>
        If you want to voice Anyone in BoNB Contact To me in Discord: <b>outspace_gigane</b> <br>

        <img src="images/Snapshot_1.PNG" alt="Part 1 Thumbnail" height="200"> <br>
