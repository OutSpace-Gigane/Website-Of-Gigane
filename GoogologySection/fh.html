        The Googology that ANYONE doesn't know about that... The Googology made by me and
        This is Inspired by a VTuber Group Called <b>"Hololive"</b> (feel free to research that!) <br>
        It effects to Every Googology {or -ology} Like it may Quantum Googology or Fictional Googology (Especially!)
        <br>
        BTW this has more Confusing, Complex words when compared to Normal FG
        <br>
        <br>
        More Powerful than Standard and Advanced FG and it goes far on Numbers.
        Even there's No Limit RN.
